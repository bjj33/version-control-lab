Something™
Developed by Brandon Jabout and Caroline Curtis

Something™ is a basic application that alters the way a user's name is presented. This application allows the user to enter their first name. Once the first name has been captirued, it asks for the user to enter a letter that is in their name. Once they enter a letter that is in their name, the application will remove that letter from their name. The user will then be prompted to enter their last name where it will be displayed with their first name.
