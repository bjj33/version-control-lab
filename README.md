Description:
This program takes the user's first name, takes a letter input from the user and removes that letter from the first name. If they input a letter that does not exist in the first name, they will get an error message and are asked to enter another letter. The new first name is then printed and converted to all capitals. Input for the user's last name is then taken and the new first name and the input last name are printed.
